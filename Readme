School Attendance Monitor: Reinforcing School Integration of Unaccompanied Minors in Greece

This project aims at the school integration of unaccompanied minors as a means for quality education and social integration.

Unaccompanied minors live in shelters with capacities for up to approx. 30 children; To decrease school dropout, tools and procedures are needed to reinforce both their own motivation to regularly attend the public school as well as the attitudes of the shelter staff concerning the importance of public education for the overall social integrative result.

The proposed aid consists of a set of files and a procedure for shelters to register and keep track of school attendance of beneficiaries. The General Secretary for Vulnerable Children of the Greek Ministry for Migration will collect local data from shelters. Most of the data registered are personal, some of them could be considered sensitive. Thus, a very strong level of protection must be built-in to the system. Every shelter maintains a database-like file with data about school registration, school class, daily presence etc. Access to data must be granted only to authorised personnel.

The shelter educator maintains a file of all studentsâ€™ data concerning school attendance and performance. This helps them to notice any divergence in the children's school attendance and record the overall schooling process timely. A staff member every morning is keeping a digital checklist of the children who went to school. Using this tool in a shelter implicitly helps to transform the children's routine as well as the staff's perspective on the importance of regular school attendance. An efficient "school climate" is established enhancing and accelerating school integration.

The set of files is kept locally in a database-like function, stored in the cloud. A central file maintained by the government gives direct access to local data from shelters. General surveillance over the progress of school attendance/integration can lead to early measures.

=================================
Unaccompanied minors live in shelters with capacities for up to approx. 30 children. Shelters provide services concerning mainly residents accommodation, health care, personal / social / legal support. Education and school integration do not seem to be among the strongest priorities of the shelters. Therefore a bunch of diverse small aids, tools and procedures are needed to reinforce both the children's own motivation to regularly attend the public school as well as the attitudes of the shelters staff concerning the importance of public education for the overall social integrative result. 
=================================
The implementation will mainly use free services of google. As containers of structured data will be used google sheets stored in the cloud as google drive files. Certain parts of contents of the different files will be exchanged between them and files will synchronize  using common google functions and google application scripts to achieve a database-like performance.  
Only authorised staff members and governmental officers will be granted access to personal data of the children, to the extent provided by national and international laws. The sets of files storing personal data will be strictly protected using common strong authorization mechanisms. Different google accounts will be used in order to define the different access levels to the data. 
Easy to use interfaces for data entry, data management, data presentation and visualisation will be designed based on well known Google Sheets functionalities.

School Attendance Monitor: Reinforcing School Integration of Unaccompanied Minors in Greece

This concept aims at the school integration of unaccompanied minors as a means for a smooth social integration as equal citizens. 

Unaccompanied minors live in shelters with capacities for up to approx. 30 children. Shelters provide services concerning mainly residents accommodation, health care, personal / social / legal support. Education and school integration do not seem to be among the strongest priorities of the shelters. Therefore a bunch of diverse small aids, tools and procedures are needed to reinforce both the children's own motivation to regularly attend the public school as well as the attitudes of the shelters staff concerning the importance of public education for the overall social integrative result. 

The proposed aid consists of a set of handy files and a procedure for every shelter to register and keep a record of the school attendance of each child they host. Simultaneously the General Secretary for Vulnerable Children (at the Ministry for Migration of the Greek government) will collect all the local data from every shelter for monitoring and support purposes. Most of the data registered are personal (such as the date of birth and the name of the student), some of them could be considered very sensitive (such as the origin, the residence or the mother tongue). Thus a very strong level of protection must be built-in to the system. Every shelter maintains a database-like file with data about the school registration, the school class, the daily presence etc. of every student. Access to that data must be granted only to authorized officers / staff members. 

The educator of the shelter maintains a file of all students with their data concerning school attendance and performance. This helps the educator to early notice any significant divergence / inconsistency in the children's school attendance and keep in general track of the overall schooling process. In addition to the data collected from the school, to better monitor the regularity/ one staff member (usually a caretaker) every morning is keeping a digital checklist of the children who went to school. Following these processes day after day in a shelter implicitly helps to transform the children's attitudes as well as the staff's perspective concerning the importance of a regular school attendance. An overall "school climate" is established that enhances and accelerates school integration. 

The set of files that every shelter is keeping locally have a database like function and are stored in the cloud. Thus a central file maintained by the General Secretariat for Vulnerable Persons and Institutional Protection of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum is able to directly access them collecting all the local data from every shelter. This possibility of general surveillance over the progress of school attendance / school integration by the government's officers can lead to early measures of reinforcement and targeted support where needed. 

In the development of SAM only free and open source tools are used, the code is free and open source and any documentation of processes, proposals etc. are Public Domain according to Creative Commons license (CC0).

Only authorised staff members and officers of the General Secretariat for Vulnerable Persons and Institutional Protection of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum have access to personal data of the children, to the extent provided by national and international laws. The sets of files storing personal data are strictly protected using common strong authorization mechanisms.

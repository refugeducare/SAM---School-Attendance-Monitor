# School Attendance Monitor: Reinforcing School Integration of Unaccompanied Minors in Greece

This project aims at the school integration of unaccompanied minors as a means for quality education and social integration.

Unaccompanied minors live in shelters with capacities for up to approx. 30 children; To decrease school dropout, tools and procedures are needed to reinforce both their own motivation to regularly attend the public school as well as the attitudes of the shelter staff concerning the importance of public education for the overall social integrative result.

The proposed aid consists of a set of files and a procedure for shelters to register and keep track of school attendance of beneficiaries. The General Secretary for Vulnerable Children of the Greek Ministry for Migration will collect local data from shelters. Most of the data registered are personal, some of them could be considered sensitive. Thus, a very strong level of protection must be built-in to the system. Every shelter maintains a database-like file with data about school registration, school class, daily presence etc. Access to data must be granted only to authorised personnel.

The shelter educator maintains a file of all studentsâ€™ data concerning school attendance and performance. This helps them to notice any divergence in the children's school attendance and record the overall schooling process timely. A staff member every morning is keeping a digital checklist of the children who went to school. Using this tool in a shelter implicitly helps to transform the children's routine as well as the staff's perspective on the importance of regular school attendance. An efficient "school climate" is established enhancing and accelerating school integration.

The set of files is kept locally in a database-like function, stored in the cloud. A central file maintained by the government gives direct access to local data from shelters. General surveillance over the progress of school attendance/integration can lead to early measures.

Only authorised staff members and officers of the General Secretariat for Vulnerable Persons and Institutional Protection of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum have access to personal data of the children, to the extent provided by national and international laws. The sets of files storing personal data are strictly protected using common strong authorization mechanisms.
